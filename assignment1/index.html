        <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The big screen box with an animated emoji smiling and a small screen box with a blinking animation that says ‘Press [symbol] to begin’. Because the screens are bigger and more prominent in colour (both have a dark fill and bright orange elements than the rest of the elements (white background with darker orange elements) on the webpage, my eyes automatically drift to that box. And after seeing those words in the box, I know as a user that it’s the instructions to start the experience. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="boxmid1">
    <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I look around the website but ultimately chose to focus on the screen that says ‘Press [symbol] to begin’. In which I then look at the buttons of different symbols and try match the one that’s on the screen with the buttons
        </li>
        <li>
            I press the button and follow the instruction of the game (which is a memory game where I have to remember the symbols that appear on the screen and press them in the same order afterwards using the buttons)
        </li>
        <li>
            After completing the game it tells me to play again, in which I press the button again to replay
        </li>
        <li>
            I look next to the buttons to see a slider and some numbers, and also notice that the number that was on the slider has changed to a star. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I interact with the slider by sliding it up to the maximum point
        </li>
        <li>
            I look at the screen that tells me I have changed the difficulty so I play the game again
        </li>
        <li>
            After completing the game and seeing that the number on the slider has been replaced with a star, I change the slider position to the lowest position
        </li>
        <li>
            Two minutes have ended

        <h3>What part of the experience did you sped most time engaging with?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I spent the most time engaging with the memory game as it had different difficulties I could play with – giving me more options with how I interact with the game. And also because sometimes the game UI prompts me to play another game by saying things like ‘best of two out of three?’ or  ‘prove that you’re not human, try again’. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The most common action was using my right mouse click button to interact with the buttons for the memory game and also using my eyes to look at the symbols that pop up in the screen box. Though it was only one side of the webpage, the game was extremely inviting for users as it prompts them to play the game more than once. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I think the intended primary goal of Downstream’s interactive web is to generate curiosity within the users about AI and how they could communicate with it for a response.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal</h3>
        <br>
        <p>With the use of brightly coloured animated elements and coded sentences. For instance, when you start the game the screen box communicates to the user what the little emoji is saying, with some remarks being friendly and some being a bit rude. However, because of this communication between the user and emoji, the user is invited to interact with the emoji by complying with its instructions for gameplay and then eventually getting the opportunity to try talk to them with your own words.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I think the webpage is likely meant to be interacted with for around 15 minutes to discover all the button functions and features. Since there are two visible areas of the webpage, 'Play the game' and 'Morton', the user's attention would lean towards the left side of the webpage where 'Morton' is due to having more interactive buttons. Then afterwards interact with the 'Play the game' side to input personal information (email) or get redirected to another page. Also, because the game has different difficulties the users can play in, I'd say users would have to play at least 3 times to explore most difficulties if they have the patience, or 5 times to complete all difficulties and then add an extra few minutes to play around with the unlocked interactive text box at the bottom of the button display.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>How does the interactive experience communciate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>As this is a website to advertise and introduce their game 'Downstream', Playmint includes a section that show their game statistics and an interactive for the users to sign up for their game. In addition to that area theres a large bright orange play button which redirects the user to their actual game sight. So I assume that the 'Play the game' section is intended to catch the user's attention first due to its extreamly large button and interactive text box. But as users realise that the play button redirects them to another browser, the other section 'Morton' would be explored. And due its interactivity as a memory game which hooks the users into playing the game a few times, it would then convince the users to explore the main game site.</p>

        <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Another form of media the experience references is animation. For instance, the emoji is animated to look alive as it blinks and changes spacial expressions, the 'enter your email' sentence is animated in the text box to look enticing and fit the theme of a technological control board. Speaking of the technological control board, another form of media referenced are graphical elements. This includes the elements on the borders of the webpage that look like screwed panels and how the containers of each interactive element looks like a 3D button or a seperate panel that pops out of the main board.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="box">
        <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>With the animated references, the users should be drawn to these animations and prompt them to click on the container that has the media and/or look at the whole animation to see if it's giving instructions or if its something important in general.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With the graphical references, these elements also take part in inviting the user to interact with its features, such as the buttons with the symbols, the user should feel some sort of curiosity to click on what looks like a button.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="box">
        <h3>What does the reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Both these references made me feel curious about the features of the website as I found myself click on each graphic that I see. Because of its control panel-like look, I knew that there would be some sort of interactivity with at least the buttons. </p>
     </div>
     <div class="box">
        <h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The most frustrating part of the interaction would probably be using the interactive text box to 'talk' with Morton the AI emoji. It was frustrating because I could only get a response from typing 'hello' and nothing else. I've tried different words and phrases hoping it would be something like ChatGPT where it would respond to anything (within reason) you would input, however there was nothing. No prompts or secret codes that I could find to talk with Morton.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="box">
        <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and hat makes that part satisfying?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The most satisfying part of the interaction would be playing the memory game and pressing the graphic symboled buttons. Because whenever I clicked on them, it would make a really nice sound which made me want to play the game more just for the sound design. It was also satisfying to complete each difficulty level as a gamer myself and unlock the final feature - the interactive text box to talk to Morton.</p>
