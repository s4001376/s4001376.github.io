        <p>
            Moo Deng is a pygmy hippopotamus born on July 10, 2024, at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand. She quickly became an internet sensation due to her adorable and startled expressions, especially a viral video where she looks terrified while being held by her caretaker. Her playful, bouncy nature earned her the nickname "Moo Deng," which means "Bouncy Pork" in Thai.
            <br><br>
            As a pygmy hippo, Moo Deng belongs to a smaller, rarer species of hippopotamus native to the forests and swamps of West Africa, primarily in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Ivory Coast. Unlike the common hippopotamus, pygmy hippos are more reclusive and spend much of their time in dense forests near water sources. They are much smaller, typically weighing between 180 to 275 kg, compared to their larger cousins, which can weigh over 1,500 kg.
            <br><br>
            Pygmy hippos are endangered, with an estimated population of fewer than 2,500 individuals in the wild. Conservation efforts are critical for their survival due to habitat destruction and hunting in their natural range.
